description: Weekly self-evolution cycle - mine learnings and usage stats, check the council's weekly numbers, propose config diffs as a reviewable changeset
argument-hint: [--dry-run to report without writing the changeset]

Run the evolution cycle. Use the `insight-harvester` and `skill-gardener` skills - they define the method. "$ARGUMENTS"

1. **Harvest.** Read `memory/learnings/` (raw + CONSOLIDATED), `memory/stats/skills.json`, and - if the user can paste it - the output of the built-in `/insights` command (ask once; proceed without it if unavailable).
2. **Council check-in** (read-only; nothing here writes anything). If `memory/stats/council.jsonl` does not exist, print `council: no rounds yet` and skip to step 3. Otherwise run the same `awk` pass `/vulyk-status` step 2 uses, restricted to the last 7 days:
   ```
   SINCE="$(date -u -d '-7 days' +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ)"
   awk -v since="$SINCE" '
     { match($0, /"ts":"[^"]*"/);      ts=substr($0, RSTART+6, RLENGTH-7) }
     ts < since { next }
     { match($0, /"spec":"[^"]*"/);    spec=substr($0, RSTART+8, RLENGTH-9) }
     { match($0, /"round":[0-9]+/);    round=substr($0, RSTART+8, RLENGTH-8) }
     { match($0, /"verdict":"[^"]*"/); verdict=substr($0, RSTART+11, RLENGTH-12) }
     {
       specs[spec]=1
       if (verdict=="GREEN" && (!(spec in firstgreen) || round+0 < firstgreen[spec]+0)) firstgreen[spec]=round
       if (verdict=="ESCALATE") escalations++
     }
     END {
       n=0; for (s in specs) n++
       g=0; for (s in firstgreen) { g++; rounds[g]=firstgreen[s]+0 }
       for (i=1;i<=g;i++) for (j=i+1;j<=g;j++) if (rounds[j]<rounds[i]) { t=rounds[i]; rounds[i]=rounds[j]; rounds[j]=t }
       med=0; if (g>0) { if (g%2==1) med=rounds[(g+1)/2]; else med=(rounds[g/2]+rounds[g/2+1])/2 }
       printf "specs:%d median:%s escalations:%d\n", n, med, escalations+0
     }
   ' memory/stats/council.jsonl
   ```
   plus the same escaped-defect grep as `/vulyk-status` step 2, restricted to briefs whose file mtime falls in the last 7 days (`date -r <brief.md> +%s` vs. `date -u -d '-7 days' +%s`). Print `council (7d): <specs> specs · median <n> rounds to green · <n> escalations · <n> escaped defects`. Then the comparison the grill names - `human.jsonl` rows with `"verdict":"REJECTED"` in the same window:
   ```
   awk -v since="$SINCE" '
     { match($0, /"ts":"[^"]*"/); ts=substr($0, RSTART+6, RLENGTH-7) }
     ts < since { next }
     $0 ~ /"verdict":"REJECTED"/ { c++ }
     END { print c+0 }
   ' memory/stats/human.jsonl
   ```
   Print `human.jsonl REJECTED (7d): <n>`. If escaped defects (7d) > REJECTED (7d), print the signal sentence: `signal: escaped defects this week (<n>) exceed what a human gate caught in a comparable span (<n>) - the "models are ready" hypothesis is losing this week; docs/grill/2026-09-12-autonomous-cycle-council.md Decision 14 names human_gate: blocking as the fallback, not a default.` Otherwise print `signal: none - escaped defects at or below the human-gate baseline`. Nothing in this step applies anything; it feeds step 3's diagnosis the way `skills.json` already does.

   **Anomaly telemetry (7d, same check-in).** Schema and enum: `docs/telemetry.md`. If `memory/stats/anomalies.jsonl` does not exist, print `anomalies: none logged yet` and skip to the consent line below. Otherwise count rows with `ts >= SINCE` (the same window as above) by `code`:
   ```
   awk -v since="$SINCE" '
     { match($0, /"ts":"[^"]*"/);   ts=substr($0, RSTART+6, RLENGTH-7) }
     ts < since { next }
     { match($0, /"code":"[^"]*"/); code=substr($0, RSTART+8, RLENGTH-9) }
     { count[code]++ }
     END { for (c in count) printf "%s\t%d\n", c, count[c] }
   ' memory/stats/anomalies.jsonl
   ```
   Print one row per code from `bash scripts/telemetry.sh enum` - `anomalies (7d): <code> <n>` (`<n>` is `0` for a code the awk pass did not emit) - beside the council stats above; no free text from the log, the schema carries none. Then run `bash scripts/telemetry.sh consent`: `off` prints its own one-line notice (`telemetry: off (Profile row Telemetry) - nothing to send`) and moves straight to step 3, nothing further sent or printed. `on` runs `bash scripts/telemetry.sh publish` - `publish --dry-run` instead when this `/vulyk-evolve` run itself carries `--dry-run` - shows its fenced command block to the owner verbatim, and states plainly that the command was printed, not run, same posture as `/vulyk-ship` step 3 (never `git commit`, never `gh`, never waits for the owner). The anomaly counts feed step 3's diagnosis the same way the council stats do.

   **The inbox, repo side (the weekly distil-and-clear).** Only when `telemetry/inbox/` exists at the repo root - that is the VULYK repository itself; a hive never has that directory, so in a hive skip this paragraph with one sentence (`inbox: not the VULYK repo - nothing to distil`) and move on. Otherwise run `bash scripts/telemetry.sh inbox`. It prints one TSV line per (week, code) - `<week> <code> <rows> <hives>` - across every bundle contributors have merged into `telemetry/inbox/`. Show that table beside the local 7-day counts above: both feed step 3's diagnosis, and the inbox table is the only evidence in this run that is not about this one machine. Put the same table verbatim into step 4's CHANGELOG entry, so the week's distillate is in the changeset a human reviews. Then, on the full path (not `--dry-run`), run `bash scripts/telemetry.sh inbox --clear`: it stages `git rm` deletions of the emptied week directories (`telemetry/inbox/README.md` survives) and commits nothing, so those deletions travel in the same reviewable changeset as the rest of step 4 and ship with the next release. Under `--dry-run` distil only - never `--clear`. A non-zero `inbox` exit is a bundle that failed `bash scripts/telemetry.sh check`: it prints `<file>:<line>: <reason>` and deletes nothing - stop this paragraph, report the reason, clear nothing, and continue to step 3 without the inbox table.
3. **Diagnose.** Produce three lists with evidence: (a) top 3 friction patterns (repeated mistakes, expensive habits, recurring re-explanations); (b) skills/rules unused for 3+ weeks -> archive candidates; (c) patterns done manually 3+ times -> new skill/rule candidates. A "signal" line from step 2 is evidence for (a), not a separate list.
4. **Propose.** On a branch `vulyk/evolve-<date>`, write the actual diffs: edits to `CLAUDE.md` project profile, `.claude/rules/`, agent prompts, new skill scaffolds; move archived skills to `.claude/skills/_graveyard/<name>/` adding `RETIRED.md` (date, reason, evidence). Append a CHANGELOG.md entry justifying EVERY change in one line each.
5. **Human gate.** Present the changeset as a review: per-change rationale, expected effect, rollback note. Apply NOTHING to the main branch yourself. With `--dry-run`, stop after the diagnosis report.

Discipline notes: prefer deleting and tightening over adding - constitutions rot by accretion; a rule that fires rarely but prevents disasters stays (frequency is not the only signal - say when you keep something for severity reasons).
