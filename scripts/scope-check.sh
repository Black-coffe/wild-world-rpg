# VULYK scope gate - the framework's only objective metric.
#
# Compares what a story DECLARED it would touch (its `## Files` block) against what the
# diff ACTUALLY touched, and records both numbers. Deterministic, no model involved,
# no tokens spent.
#
#   Usage: scripts/scope-check.sh <story-file> [git-diff-range]
#          scripts/scope-check.sh docs/specs/oauth/oauth-01.md
#          scripts/scope-check.sh docs/specs/oauth/oauth-01.md main...HEAD
#
# Default range is the working tree (staged + unstaged) against HEAD. Since v0.5.0 the
# build loop commits per story, so at the moment /vulyk-build runs this - after a worker
# returns, before its story is committed - the default range is exactly that story's
# diff. Earlier stories are already behind HEAD and no longer contaminate the numbers.
# To re-measure a story after its commit, pass its range: `scope-check.sh <story> HEAD~1..HEAD`.
#
# Two numbers are recorded, and the second one is what stops the first from being gamed:
#   out_of_scope  - files changed that the story never named   (lower is better)
#   declared      - how many paths the story named             (a story that lists half
#                   the repo scores a perfect zero and is caught by this number)
#
# The story file itself is never counted: the build loop commits it alongside the code
# (status line, one-commit-per-story), so it is bookkeeping, not scope.
#
# Exit status is always 0: this reports, it does not block. Blocking is lead-review's job.
