# VULYK ship gate - which stage of the cycle is a spec at, and may it be published?
#
#   Usage: scripts/ship-check.sh <spec-dir>                       # READY or NOT READY, and why
#          scripts/ship-check.sh --record <spec-dir> <version> [where it was published]
#
# Six stages, six confirmation artifacts (docs/cycle.md). This script reads every one of
# them - brief, approval line, branch line, story statuses, the blind gate's verdict, the
# owner's check - and says which is missing or stale. Deterministic, no model, no tokens.
# `/vulyk-ship` runs it first and refuses on NOT READY, the way `/vulyk-build` refuses
# without an approval line. It is the reason "did anyone actually look?" is a question
# with a file behind it rather than a memory.
#
# `--record` writes stage 06's own artifact once the human has pressed the button: a
# `**Shipped:**` line in plan.md and a row in memory/stats/ship.jsonl. The publishing
# itself is never done here and never by an agent.
#
# Exit status is always 0: this reports, it does not block. The refusing is the command's.
