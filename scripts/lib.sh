# Extracted (autonomous-cycle ADR-001, story 01) from the four scripts that each carried a
# verbatim copy - ship-check.sh, human-check.sh, acceptance-log.sh, release-check.sh - so
# `paperwork_only()`'s whitelist ("every file the cycle writes") is one list that must agree
# with itself, instead of four that must agree by hand. This file only defines functions and
# sets no state, so sourcing it twice - or from two scripts in the same process - is harmless.
#
# Consumers migrate to this file in story 02; it is created here and used here (by cycle.sh)
# only. Not a script in its own right: nothing below runs on its own, so there is no `exit`.

# is_paperwork_path() is the one whitelist (C1, amended R23/R4, autonomous-cycle-21): every
# caller that must tell the cycle's own writes from the software - paperwork_only() below and
# open-round's own dirty-tree precondition - goes through this single function, so the ADR
# invariant ("paperwork_only() lists every file the cycle writes") cannot drift into two lists
# that quietly disagree. Anchored to docs/specs/*/ (R23/m-2): an unanchored `*/council/*` or
# `*/journal.md` matched any hive path sharing those names, not just the cycle's own. brief.md
# joins the set because `reopen` writes it; scope.jsonl joins the memory/stats series because
# `close-story` writes it through scope-check.sh (R4/C-3(b)).
