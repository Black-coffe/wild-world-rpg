# VULYK acceptance drift log - fourth deterministic record, beside scope/wave/trace.
#
#   Usage: scripts/acceptance-log.sh <spec-dir> <ACCEPTED|REJECTED|CANNOT_RUN> [note]
#          scripts/acceptance-log.sh docs/specs/oauth REJECTED "logout ask never wired up"
#          scripts/acceptance-log.sh --check <spec-dir>       # is the newest verdict still about THIS pack?
#
# `drone-acceptance` judges the built software against brief.md alone - it never sees the
# stories, so it does not know what the hive believes it finished. This script writes down
# both accounts side by side and computes the only number worth keeping:
#
#   drift = the stories all say `done` and the blind gate did NOT accept.
#
# That is the framework contradicting its own story about itself, and it is the one series
# no other gate in VULYK can produce. Read it for what it is: `drift` is evidence about
# DELIVERY - whether the asks got built - and never about PROOF that the build is sound.
# The two are independent, and the first real run showed it: the blind gate accepted a pack
# `lead-review` then blocked twice, on coverage holes that were entirely real. A long run of
# `false` says the pipeline delivers what was asked; it says nothing about how well anyone
# checked.
#
# A verdict is about the pack that existed when the drone ran, so each record carries that
# pack's IDENTITY - `head` (the commit) and `pack` (a fingerprint over the story files) -
# not merely its size. Without them the series is falsifiable by ordinary process: run the
# gate, let review carve out repair stories, ship. The record then reads ACCEPTED with no
# drift about a pack the gate never saw, which is exactly what happened on the first real
# run (katan S2.6.5a: accepted at six stories, shipped at nine). `--check` is what makes
# that visible - it recomputes the fingerprint and says whether the newest verdict for this
# spec still describes it.
#
# Story statuses come from the spec dir (frontmatter `status:`), the verdict from the
# caller - the Queen, right after reading the drone's report. Deterministic, no model.
# Exit status is always 0: this records, it does not block.

# exists, which still catches the case that actually happened.
