# VULYK human check - stage 05 of the cycle, the one no agent may take.
#
#   Usage: scripts/human-check.sh <spec-dir> <ACCEPTED|REJECTED> [where you looked / note]
#          scripts/human-check.sh docs/specs/oauth ACCEPTED "staging, logged in as a new user, logout works"
#          scripts/human-check.sh --check <spec-dir>       # is the newest check still about THIS pack at THIS commit?
#
# The blind acceptance gate can say the software does what the brief's words said. Only
# the person who wrote the words can say whether the words said what they meant, so the
# owner looks - on a test or a live version - and this script writes down that they did.
# It never judges anything: the verdict is the caller's, and the caller is a human. The
# Queen runs it AFTER the owner has answered, quoting their words in the note, and never
# before - a check recorded on the owner's behalf is the failure this stage exists to stop.
#
# Two records, same fact:
#   plan.md                  - one `**Checked:**` line appended, beside `**Approved:**`: the
#                              artifact /vulyk-ship refuses without.
#   memory/stats/human.jsonl - the same line as data, stamped with the commit and the pack
#                              fingerprint it was given against, so `--check` can say whether
#                              a later commit or a repair story has made it about something else.
#
# Exit status is always 0: this records, it does not block. `/vulyk-ship` is what blocks.
