# ADR-001: The cycle's state contract - one truth on disk, two thin drivers

- Status: accepted (2026-09-13, owner: Andrei)
- Date: 2026-09-12
- Spec: docs/specs/autonomous-cycle (v0.12.0)

## Context

v0.12.0 replaces stage 05 (the mandatory human look) with an agent council and moves the
loop *build -> gates -> council -> repair* out of the Queen's session. The loop must run under
two drivers with identical behaviour: (1) `.claude/workflows/vulyk-cycle.js`, a Workflow
script - deterministic, background, resumable, unable to ask a human; (2) the Queen's own
session stepping through the same loop where Workflow is unavailable (Claude Code < 2.1.154,
Pro without the flag).

Two facts decide the shape. First, the constitution: a stage is closed by a file on disk,
never by a chat turn, and every existing gate (`acceptance-log.sh`, `human-check.sh`,
`ship-check.sh`) is a model-free script whose record carries the commit and the pack
fingerprint it was given against. Second, the Workflow runtime: a script has **no filesystem,
no shell, no Node API and no clock** - only `agent()`, `parallel()`, `pipeline()`, `phase()`,
`log()`. It cannot hold a round counter that survives a crash, cannot write a ledger, and its
resume replays cached `agent()` results by call order. Whatever the loop's truth is, the
script cannot be where it lives.

The adversarial review named the gaps this ADR closes: where the round counter lives (2.4),
how evidence survives a crash (2.4), how a human takes the tree back (2.5, 5.3), how BLOCK,
STALE and "round" compose (5.2), and who computes a verdict (4.1: the grill settled it - a
script judges rounds, the Queen only escalation and the final report).

## Options

1. **Deterministic phases as bash scripts with one stable CLI; both drivers call them and
   branch on a `next:` field.** Tradeoff: one more clerk agent per phase in the Workflow
   (Haiku, ~1 turn) because the script cannot run bash itself.
2. **Logic in the Workflow script, duplicated in the command prompt for the fallback.**
   Tradeoff: two implementations of the verdict rule and the ceiling; the JS half is
   untestable in a bash-only CI; the round counter lives in a run's memory and resets on
   restart - the ceiling becomes unreachable in the crash it exists for.
3. **One long-running foreman agent that dispatches seats via nested `Agent`.** Tradeoff:
   needs the nested-subagent setting in every hive; the foreman's context accumulates every
   report (the cost Workflow exists to avoid); it dies with a crash; its verdicts are a
   model's, not a rule's, so two runs can disagree on the same evidence.
4. **Extend `state.sh` to carry round state.** Rejected outright: `state.sh` is a derived,
   gitignored view; a derived file cannot be the truth of anything.

## Decision

*Amended 2026-09-13, plan delta 6 of `docs/specs/autonomous-cycle`.*

### Amendments (2026-09-13)

Council round 1 (`council/round-1/review.md`) found D1, D2, D4, D5 and D6 out of step with
what stories 19-21 already made true, and the court's blindness under-specified as a
guarantee it cannot be. This section records what changed and why; the Options and Context
above stay as first written.

- **D1** - the seat-file row's `Committed` column now reads `at judge --commit` (or the
  STALE fold), not `yes`: seat files reach git only when `judge` commits them, never at
  `record-seat` time (R26) - four concurrent `record-seat --commit`s would contend on one
  index while seats run in parallel.
- **D2** - `open-round` writes the ESCALATE row, `**Council:**` line and `## Needs a human`
  itself, idempotently, before exiting 6 at the ceiling (R5); `escalate` is a standalone verb
  - `escalate <spec> [--commit] [--reason <ceiling|half|env>] ["<note>"]` - for an open round
  with seats missing (court removed, no seat precondition), and behaves as `judge` when
  nothing is missing; `close-story`'s precondition now names the `## Commands` rule that
  keeps an untrusted `## Verification` line from reaching a shell as anything but a known
  command (R11); `record-seat`'s taint clause is path-anchored, not bare-word (R9); a RED
  verdict from `judge` is a successful judgement and exits 0 - 4 is `record-seat` MALFORMED
  and `close-story` red verification only (R24).
- **D4** - `half` reads `|RED_e| >= max(2, ceil(A / 2))` so a one- or two-ask brief never
  escalates on a single RED alone (R10); the ABSENT row is generalized: any required seat
  (C15) missing, with nothing RED and review not BLOCK, escalates as `env` (R16), replacing
  the old fixed "all three seats ABSENT" phrasing now that required seats vary by tier.
- **D5** - restated as the honour clause it always was: the court is shared and writable,
  not the sealed room the old wording implied; its blindness is a detector, not a filesystem
  guarantee (R15).
- **D6** - an in-flight seat's report is discarded on `/vulyk-pause`, not recorded on
  resume; the seat is re-dispatched instead (R19).
- **D1/D2** - D2's illustrative driver code block is replaced by a pointer to
  `.claude/workflows/vulyk-cycle.js`; D1 gains the `council/REOPEN`/`council/CEILING` rows and
  the `ROUND` row's `tier=` line (plan delta 7, R34).

Option 1. The loop state is a small set of committed files, each with exactly one writer,
all written by `scripts/cycle.sh`; the verdict is computed by that script from labelled
lines in seat reports; both drivers are a `while` loop over `cycle.sh status --json` that
performs the one action named in `next` and nothing else.

### D1. Files, owners, schemas

| File | Writer | Content / schema | Committed |
|---|---|---|---|
| `docs/specs/<slug>/brief.md` `## Asks` | `/vulyk-plan` at grill close | numbered list `1. <verbatim ask>`; A = its length; the council judges only these | yes |
| `plan.md` `**Briefed:** via grill, <owner>, <date>` | `cycle.sh briefed` (called by `/vulyk-plan`) | stage 01+02 in autonomous mode; `**Approved:**` stays for the two-stop mode; `/vulyk-build` and `ship-check.sh` accept either | yes |
| `plan.md` `**Branch:** vulyk/<slug>` | `cycle.sh branch` (called by `/vulyk-build` / the driver) | unchanged meaning | yes |
| `plan.md` `**Council:** <GREEN\|RED\|ESCALATE\|STALE> round <N>, <date>, at <head>, pack <fp>[ - red: 2,5]` | `cycle.sh judge` / `escalate` | appended, never replaced, one line per round - a mirror of the ledger row, human-readable | yes |
| `plan.md` `## Needs a human` | `cycle.sh escalate` | reason (`ceiling` / `half` / `env`), one row per RED ask with its evidence across rounds, paths of the seat files | yes |
| `plan.md` `**Checked:**` | `human-check.sh` (unchanged) | optional override: `ACCEPTED` outranks a RED/ESCALATE, `REJECTED` outranks a GREEN | yes |
| `docs/specs/<slug>/council/round-N/ROUND` | `cycle.sh open-round` | **the open marker**: `head=<sha>` `pack=<fp>` `opened=<ts>` `court=<path>` `ceiling=<3\|6\|...>` `tier=<1\|2\|3\|4>`; `mkdir` of the directory is the atomic act | yes |
| `docs/specs/<slug>/council/REOPEN` | `cycle.sh reopen` | one line per cleared ESCALATE round, never rewritten: `round=<N> · <ts>`; `status` reads it to tell an ESCALATE row a human already reopened from one still waiting | yes |
| `docs/specs/<slug>/council/CEILING` | `cycle.sh reopen` | single line, the round ceiling after this reopen (`<old>+3`); `open-round` reads it in place of the default 3 | yes |
| `docs/specs/<slug>/council/round-N/<haiku\|sonnet\|opus\|review>.md` | `cycle.sh record-seat` (stdin) | seat report verbatim under one header comment `<!-- seat: sonnet · model: <id\|alias> · round: 2 · head: … · pack: … · attempt: 1 · recorded: <ts> -->`; a rejected attempt is kept as `<seat>.attempt-K.md` | at `judge --commit` (or the STALE fold) |
| `memory/stats/council.jsonl` | `cycle.sh judge` / `escalate` | **the close marker**, one flat row per round (schema below) | yes |
| `docs/specs/<slug>/journal.md` | `scripts/journal.sh` only (from `cycle.sh`, `/vulyk-plan`, `/vulyk-ship`, hooks) | append-only, one line per state change: `- <ts> · <stage> · <what happened> · next: <what next>`; stage vocabulary = `state.sh` stages + `paused` | yes |
| `docs/specs/<slug>/PAUSE` | `cycle.sh pause` or a human's `touch` | first line: who/why; a semaphore, not a record - the journal line is the record | **no** (gitignored) |
| `.vulyk/court/<slug>/round-N/` | `cycle.sh open-round` / `judge` | git worktree at the pack commit, `docs/specs/<slug>/` reduced to `brief.md` | **no** (gitignored) |
| `.claude/state.json` | `state.sh` (unchanged) | gains stages `04-council:<verdict>` and `paused`; derived, never truth | no |

`council.jsonl` row (flat on purpose - the existing readers extract fields with a greedy
`sed`, so no nested object may contain a key named `verdict`):

```
{"ts":"2026-09-13T02:14:07Z","spec":"<slug>","round":2,"verdict":"GREEN|RED|ESCALATE|STALE",
 "head":"abc1234","pack":"1a2b3c4d5e6f","asks":7,"red":[2,5],"red_unevidenced":[],"na":1,
 "review":"PASS|BLOCK|ABSENT","haiku":"GREEN|RED|N/A|ABSENT","haiku_model":"<id or alias>",
 "sonnet":"…","sonnet_model":"…","opus":"…","opus_model":"…","attempts":4,
 "escalate":"ceiling|half|env|null","note":"<one line, redacted>"}
```

**Resume and atomicity.** The round counter is the number of `council/round-*` directories;
it lives in git, never in a run. A round is *open* when its `ROUND` file exists and no
`council.jsonl` row carries its number. Crash rules, all handled by `open-round` and `judge`
being idempotent:

- `round-N/` exists without `ROUND` -> nothing happened; `open-round` rewrites `ROUND`.
- open round, HEAD unchanged -> resume it: seats whose file exists are *done*, the rest
  are *missing*; nothing is re-dispatched that already returned.
- open round, HEAD moved (a manual code commit, a repair) -> the round is stale. With no
  seat file, `open-round` re-stamps it in place; with any seat file, it writes a `STALE`
  row for N (it was a dispatch, it counts against the ceiling) and opens N+1.
- row written, `**Council:**` line or journal line missing -> `judge` recomputes and writes
  whichever of the three is absent, in the fixed order seat files -> row -> plan line ->
  journal. The row is authoritative; the line is its mirror.

`paperwork_only()` in `ship-check.sh` and `human-check.sh` gains `*/council/*`,
`*/journal.md`, `memory/stats/council.jsonl`, so recording a round never stales a round.

### D2. The phase CLI

One script, `scripts/cycle.sh <verb> <spec-dir> [...]`, plus `scripts/journal.sh`. Unlike
the report-only gates, this is a machine contract: **exit codes mean something**, and the
last stdout line is always one JSON object so no driver parses prose.

| Verb | Precondition (exit 2 names the failing one) | Effect |
|---|---|---|
| `status <spec> [--json]` | - | derives everything above; prints `next` (below); never writes |
| `briefed <spec> [--commit]` | `## Asks` present, non-empty | writes `**Briefed:**`; journal |
| `branch <spec> [--commit]` | Briefed or Approved | creates/switches `vulyk/<slug>`, writes `**Branch:**` |
| `close-story <story-file> [--commit]` | worker returned; every `&&`-separated segment of every `## Verification` line equals, byte for byte, a row of the hive's `CLAUDE.md` `## Commands` table (or the line is the literal `none — reviewed by lead-review`, which runs nothing), else exit 2 naming the segment | `scope-check.sh`, `## Verification` x `repeat:`, `status: done`, commit `story(<id>): <title>`; exit 4 on red verification (the driver routes to the repair path of `/vulyk-build` step 5) |
| `open-round <spec> [--commit]` | Branch; all stories `done`/`blocked`; clean tree; `## Asks`; not paused; round count < ceiling | `mkdir round-N`, `ROUND`, opens the court, journal; at the ceiling, writes the ESCALATE row, `**Council:**` line, `## Needs a human` and the journal line itself (idempotently), then exits 6 `ESCALATE` instead |
| `record-seat <spec> <N> <seat> [--model <id>] < report` | open round; not stale by `round_is_stale` | validates the report contract (D3); writes the seat file; exit 4 `MALFORMED` (kept as `attempt-K`) when a label is missing, an ask number is uncovered, a RED lacks evidence, or the report is **tainted** - contains `docs/specs/<slug>/plan.md`, `docs/specs/<slug>/journal.md`, `docs/specs/<slug>/council/`, the same three with `docs/specs/` omitted, or a story id `<slug>-NN` (two digits, word-bounded); bare `plan.md`, `journal.md`, `council/`, another directory's `journal.md` and command-file names are not taint |
| `judge <spec> [--commit]` | four seat files present, or a seat exhausted its two attempts (`ABSENT`) | computes the verdict (D4), row -> line -> journal, removes the court |
| `escalate <spec> [--commit] [--reason <ceiling\|half\|env>] ["<note>"]` | a standalone verb: an open round with seats missing (court removed, no seat precondition) | records the escalation - row, `**Council:** ESCALATE`, `## Needs a human`, journal; behaves as `judge` when nothing is missing |
| `reopen <spec> "<owner's decision>" [--commit]` | last row is ESCALATE | appends the decision verbatim to `brief.md` `## Answers`, raises `ceiling` by 3 in the next `ROUND`, journal |
| `pause <spec> ["why"]` / `resume <spec>` | - | creates / removes `PAUSE`; journal; `resume` prints `stale: true` if HEAD moved while paused |

Every mutating verb checks `PAUSE` first and exits **3 `PAUSED`** without acting; `status`,
`pause`, `resume` are exempt. Exit codes: 0 ok (a RED verdict from `judge` is a successful
judgement and exits 0 too) · 1 usage · 2 precondition · 3 paused · 4 `record-seat` MALFORMED
/ `close-story` red verification only · 5 stale · 6 escalate. `--commit` commits the
paperwork as `vulyk(<slug>): <verb> …`; both drivers always pass it, so paperwork commits are
uniform.

`status.next` is one of: `briefed` · `branch` · `build:<wave>` · `close-story:<file>` ·
`open-round` · `dispatch:<missing seats, comma-separated>` · `judge` · `repair` · `green` ·
`escalated` · `paused` · `shipped`. It is the entire interface between the state and a driver.

**The Workflow driver** is a loop with no verdict logic. The runtime forbids shell access, so
every verb is run by `cycle-clerk` (`.claude/agents/cycle-clerk.md`: `model: haiku`,
`tools: Bash`, `maxTurns: 5`, prompt "run exactly this command, return the last stdout line
verbatim"; needs `Bash(bash scripts/cycle.sh:*)` and `Bash(bash scripts/journal.sh:*)` in the
hive's allowlist, which `install.sh` adds). A seat's report reaches `record-seat` as a
heredoc in the clerk's prompt; the contract validation is what catches a garbled copy.

The canonical driver is `.claude/workflows/vulyk-cycle.js`, launched with `args: { spec,
top_model, second_model, stamp }` (`stamp` a per-run random value the launcher takes once,
never derived from the clock - R31). It holds no verdict logic itself: each iteration it reads
`status.next` and takes the one action D2's verb table above names - `build:<wave>` fans
workers out over `pipeline()` and closes each story through `close-story`; `open-round` and
`judge` each cross one clerk call; `dispatch:<seats>` sends the missing seats and records every
result through `record-seat` with a per-seat random delimiter, never the literal `EOF` (R11);
`repair` hands `st.red` and the review verdict to `queen-planner`. The `review` seat is
`lead-review`; at Tier 4 it is dispatched twice, on `top_model` and `second_model`, and folded
by the driver into one recorded report before `record-seat` ever sees it - the fold never
manufactures a verdict from a blank (R28). Every clerk result is acted on per the exit-code
line above: `ok:false` ends the run in the `stop` shape, except a `record-seat` MALFORMED
re-asks the seat once and a second failed `close-story` for the same file ends the run naming
the file instead of an exit code.

**The fallback driver** (`/vulyk-build` when the session brief reports "Workflow: unavailable")
runs the same `status` -> act loop with the Queen's own Bash for the verbs and the Agent tool
for seats. Same files, same verbs, same `next`; the difference is only whose context the
reports pass through. `/vulyk-status` and the SessionStart brief say which driver is active.

**Resume is the disk, not the run.** `/vulyk-resume` relaunches the Workflow fresh (`args:
{spec, top_model, second_model, stamp}` with `stamp` from the shell) and never passes `resumeFromRunId`: a
cached `status` result replayed after a human touched the tree is exactly the wrong answer.
A fresh launch costs one clerk call per already-closed step; it never re-dispatches a seat
whose file exists.

### D3. The council report contract

A seat's final message is exactly this, 40 lines max. Seats never write files
(`disallowedTools: Write, Edit, NotebookEdit`); the driver records.

```
COUNCIL: <slug> · round <N> · seat <haiku|sonnet|opus>
MODEL: <model id if the seat knows it, else "unknown">
COURT: <absolute path of the worktree it worked in>
VERDICT: GREEN | RED | N/A
ASSUMED CONFIG: <configuration judged against - from the Profile row, or "none given">
RAN: <commands actually executed, or "nothing">
PATH: <client path walked and how far - or "none named">
ASK <n>: GREEN | RED | N/A - <ask, short> - run: <cmd> saw: <output> | url: <where> saw: <what> | why: <reason>
UNASKED: <behaviour nobody asked for> | none
BREACH: none | <what was read that should not have been, and what was re-verified after>
```

Mechanical rules `record-seat` enforces: one `ASK <n>` line per number in `## Asks`, no
extras; `VERDICT` is `RED` iff some ask is RED, `N/A` iff every ask is N/A, else `GREEN`;
evidence tokens are `run:`+`saw:` or `url:`+`saw:` for GREEN/RED and `why:` for N/A.
A missing token is `MALFORMED` -> the seat is re-asked once with the gap named; on the second
attempt an unevidenced RED **stays RED** (the grill's rule) but is listed under
`red_unevidenced` and does not count toward the half-of-asks trigger, and an unevidenced
GREEN becomes N/A. `lead-review` keeps its own contract; `record-seat … review` extracts
only `PASS`/`BLOCK` and stores the whole report. An environmental failure (`EADDRINUSE`, a
missing service) is `N/A - why: environment: …`, never RED - a gate that names its own
interference is believed, as `docs/pipeline.md` already says.

### D4. The verdict rule (`cycle.sh judge`)

A = number of asks; RED_e = asks with an evidenced RED in any seat; RED_u = unevidenced
after re-ask; N = this round's number; C = ceiling from `ROUND` (3, +3 per `reopen`).

| Condition (first match wins) | Round verdict | `next` |
|---|---|---|
| `PAUSE` exists | none - `judge` exits 3 | `paused` |
| `**Checked:** REJECTED` newer than this round's `ROUND` | RED (owner outranks council) | `repair` |
| any required seat (C15) ABSENT, RED_e ∪ RED_u empty, review != BLOCK | ESCALATE, `escalate:"env"`, `note` names the absent seats | `escalated` |
| \|RED_e\| >= max(2, ceil(A / 2)) | ESCALATE, `escalate:"half"` - the plan is wrong, rounds are not burnt | `escalated` |
| review = BLOCK, or RED_e ∪ RED_u non-empty | RED; if N >= C -> ESCALATE, `escalate:"ceiling"` | `repair` / `escalated` |
| every seat GREEN or N/A, review PASS | GREEN | `green` |
| every seat N/A, review PASS | GREEN with `na:3` - passes on lead-review + story verification only (Tier 1 and VULYK itself) | `green` |

A round is one dispatch of `lead-review` ∥ three seats on one pack commit. Any fix - for a
BLOCK or a RED - is a new commit, therefore a new round; BLOCK never spawns a round of its
own. `ship-check.sh` stage 04+05 becomes: newest `council.jsonl` row for the spec is GREEN,
its `pack` is the current fingerprint, its `head` is HEAD or only paperwork landed since -
or, for specs recorded before v0.12.0, the acceptance row as today. A `**Checked:**
ACCEPTED` newer than the row satisfies the stage regardless of the row's verdict; the
ledger then shows both.

### D5. The court - an honour clause with a detector

`open-round` creates `.vulyk/court/<slug>/round-N/` with `git worktree add --detach <path>
<head>`, deletes everything under `docs/specs/<slug>/` except `brief.md` (stories, `plan.md`,
`journal.md`, `council/`), then commits that reduction inside the court, detached, never
touching the main tree's history: an orientation `git status` there comes back clean, and
`HEAD:docs/specs/<slug>/plan.md` no longer resolves. The court is a **shared, writable**
worktree that all three seats work in at once, and nothing on disk stops a seat from writing
to it. `Read`/`Grep` stay in the seats' toolset; its working tree holds `brief.md` and
nothing else under `docs/specs/<slug>/`. Its git history is out of bounds the same way a story
id is: `git log`, `git show`, `git diff` against any commit, and the deleted-file lines of
`git status`, are a **BREACH** a seat must name in its report and re-verify independently. A
seat's writes are forbidden and discarded when `judge` removes the worktree (`git worktree
remove --force`, then `prune`); an orphaned court from a crash is removed by the next
`open-round`. None of this is filesystem-enforced - it is an honour clause with a detector:
`record-seat` marks a report tainted when it names a story id, `plan.md`, `journal.md` or
`council/` (D2's path-anchored clause), and re-asks once. The sonnet seat's suite run may
leave files the other two see; that is accepted, not prevented - a per-seat court would cost
a pack-commit worktree each, the expense D1 avoids by sharing one. The suite command goes to
the sonnet seat only, the *Client path* row (parallel-safe by the Profile's own rule: headless
runner, curl, CLI) to all three, and the *Browser MCP* row to the haiku seat only. `lead-review`
never enters the court - it needs the stories - and runs in the main tree at the same commit.

### D6. Human intervention

`/vulyk-pause <slug>` = `cycle.sh pause`; the Workflow stops at its next clerk call - a seat
already running finishes, but under PAUSE the tree is the human's and a report against it is
a report against a moving target, so it is discarded rather than recorded, and the seat is
re-dispatched on resume. The journal and the terminal
print, at loop start, "the loop holds the working tree of `vulyk/<slug>`; to edit, run
`/vulyk-pause`". `/vulyk-resume <slug>` = `cycle.sh resume` then a fresh driver launch.
A manual code commit at any point makes the open round or the newest verdict `STALE` by the
same `paperwork_only` rule the human check uses today; the next `open-round` opens a new
round, and the ceiling still counts it. After `ESCALATE` the owner has three exits, all on
the record: `human-check.sh ACCEPTED` (ship over the council), `cycle.sh reopen "<decision>"`
(three more rounds, the decision quoted into `## Answers`), or leaving the spec open.

## Consequences

- **Easier:** one implementation of the verdict, the ceiling and staleness, tested in bash
  on every push; a driver that fits on one screen; a loop that survives `/clear`, a crash and
  a hive without Workflow identically; evidence the Queen reads from files at wake, not from
  a transcript. Blindness is an honour clause with a detector, not a filesystem guarantee (D5).
- **Harder / accepted debt:** the Workflow script is not executed in CI (bash-only runner);
  it is kept logic-free so that a `node --check` is all it needs where node exists. The clerk
  adds ~5 Haiku calls per round (each one turn, negligible). A seat's report crosses one
  Haiku copy on its way to disk; the contract check catches a mangled copy, a faithful
  paraphrase it cannot. `MODEL:` is `unknown` where a seat cannot see its own id, which
  weakens the rollback signal's comparability - recorded honestly rather than invented.
- **Token cost** (goes into `docs/token-economy.md`): per round, 3 cold-cache seats (one
  Opus-class) + `lead-review` at the top model + clerks; on RED, one planner dispatch at the
  top model plus workers. Against today's 1 Sonnet + 1 Opus per spec that is roughly 2-3x the
  gate cost at the target of <= 2 rounds. The fallback driver pays the same dispatches and
  additionally carries ~120 lines of reports per round through a pinned top-model session -
  the most expensive path, and `/vulyk-status` says so.
- **Migration:** `templates/plan.md` gains `**Briefed:**` and `**Council:**` placeholders;
  `ship-check.sh`, `human-check.sh`, `state.sh` learn the new files; `drone-acceptance.md`
  becomes three seat agents plus `cycle-clerk.md`; `.gitignore` gains `.vulyk/` and
  `docs/specs/*/PAUSE`; `install.sh` adds the two `Bash(...)` allow rules. Specs recorded
  under v0.11 keep working through the acceptance row.
- **Tests that must exist** (`tests/council.test.sh`, wired into `ci.yml` beside
  `cycle.test.sh`, synthetic repo, fixture reports): GREENx3+PASS -> GREEN; one evidenced RED
  -> RED; unevidenced RED -> exit 4 then RED on attempt 2 and excluded from `half`; 4 of 7
  asks RED -> ESCALATE `half`; three RED rounds -> ESCALATE `ceiling`; `reopen` -> ceiling 6;
  `ROUND` without a row -> `status` says open and lists missing seats; row without a plan
  line -> `judge` completes it; manual commit on an open round with a seat file -> STALE row
  and round N+1; `PAUSE` -> every mutating verb exits 3; `paperwork_only` accepts council
  commits; `ship-check` READY on `Briefed` + GREEN, NOT READY on RED, READY on RED +
  `Checked: ACCEPTED`, NOT READY on GREEN + `Checked: REJECTED`; a report naming `demo-01`
  -> tainted; the court contains `brief.md` and nothing else under the spec; `judge` removes
  the court.

## Invariants created

- The verdict of a round is computed only by `scripts/cycle.sh judge`; no model writes
  `**Council:**`, `council.jsonl` or `## Needs a human`.
- The round counter is the set of `docs/specs/<slug>/council/round-*` directories in git.
  A driver never holds it, and a resume never trusts a cached copy of it.
- A round is one dispatch on one pack commit; any commit after it is a new round, and
  STALE rounds with a seat file count toward the ceiling.
- Seats return reports, never write files; the driver records them through `record-seat`,
  which validates the contract before anything reaches disk.
- A seat report that names a story id, `plan.md`, `journal.md` or `council/` is tainted.
- The council works in a worktree at the pack commit whose `docs/specs/<slug>/` holds only
  `brief.md`; `lead-review` never works there.
- `PAUSE` is honoured by every mutating verb of `cycle.sh`, not by a driver's goodwill.
- `.claude/workflows/vulyk-cycle.js` contains no verdict, ceiling or staleness logic; it
  switches on `status.next` and dispatches agents.
- Paperwork commits are made only by `cycle.sh --commit` as `vulyk(<slug>): …`, and
  `paperwork_only()` lists every file the cycle writes.

## Revisit when

- A third driver appears (a cron/`claude -p` runner) - the `status`/`next` contract must
  hold for it unchanged, or the contract was not the truth.

  `red` - the "unevidenced RED stays RED" rule is then costing rounds without catching
  defects and should flip to N/A.
- Claude Code gives Workflow scripts a shell or filesystem primitive - the clerk agent
  becomes a direct call; the CLI stays.
- A hive's Client path cannot be made parallel-safe - seats then need sequential dispatch
  (`dispatch:` one seat at a time), which the `next` contract already permits.
