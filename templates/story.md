<!--
Size budget: keep this file under ~1500 tokens (~6 KB). A story that does not fit is
an epic wearing a disguise - split it. The budget is the mechanism: it forces the
planner to decide what matters instead of pasting everything it read.
The `## Requirements` quotes are EXEMPT from the budget - verbatim user words are never
trimmed to fit.

# <Story title>

## Goal
<one paragraph - what exists after this story that does not exist now>

## Requirements
<!--
Tier 2+ only; Tier 0-1 stories skip this section (ceremony floor). VERBATIM quotes from
the spec's brief.md - the user's words, not a paraphrase - one `> ` blockquote line per
quoted fragment. Quote the shortest fragment that justifies this story; a story that
cannot quote any requirement is speculative work (cut it, or surface it as an assumption
at the approval stop). `scripts/trace-check.sh` matches these lines against brief.md
(and `## Plan deltas` in plan.md for stories cut after approval) whitespace-normalized
and VERBATIM - do not fix the user's grammar inside a quote.
-->
> <verbatim fragment from brief.md>

## Files
<!--
MACHINE-READABLE. One repo-relative path or glob per line, prefixed with "- ".
No prose, no comments on the same line - `scripts/scope-check.sh` parses this block
and compares it against the actual diff. Prose here silently breaks the scope gate.
This list is also the Law 3 boundary: the worker may touch nothing else.
AND it is the collision key for waves: two stories in the same wave must not share a
path - `scripts/wave-check.sh` reports any overlap before the wave is dispatched.

## Non-goals
<!--
What a capable worker will be tempted to do here and must NOT. This is the highest-value
section in the template: models expand scope when the task looks small next to their
capability, and an explicit stop-list is cheaper than a review round.
Write what THIS story invites, not generic prohibitions - "do not also migrate the old
callers" beats "do not write bad code". If the list reads as noise, that is a signal the
goal is under-specified, not that the section is useless.

## Map slice
<memory/map/<module>.md sections the worker should load>

## Acceptance criteria
- [ ] <observable behavior, not implementation detail>
- [ ] <...>

## Verification
<!--
The QUIET form of the command - `--reporter=dot`, `-q`, `--silent`. Output under 30 000
characters is pasted into the worker's context verbatim and resent on every turn that
follows, so a chatty reporter can cost more than the code it verifies. Take the variant
from `## Commands` in CLAUDE.md.

The command must be able to FAIL for this story: its scope has to reach the paths under
`## Files`. `wave-check.sh` reports the obvious case (`verify-gap`) when the command names
paths that miss them, but it cannot see the quieter one - an ignore file (`.prettierignore`,
`testPathIgnorePatterns`, a lint excludes list) that removes exactly the files this story
touches and turns green into a statement about nothing. When the tool has such a list,
check it here, at plan time.

Optional `repeat: N` on its own line, when the surface under test is known to be flaky:
the Queen and the worker run the command N times and all N must pass. Derive N from the
measured frequency, never from habit - five runs catch a 1-in-5 flake about two times in
three, and a 1-in-25 flake fewer than one time in five (that one needs ~75 runs to be
worth calling evidence). If you do not know the rate, say so in `## Acceptance criteria`
rather than inventing a count.
-->
`<exact command the worker runs to prove the criteria>`

## Tracer
<!--
Only when `tracer: true`. The first story of an epic should cut through every layer with
the thinnest possible slice - one route, one record, one assertion - before the remaining
stories add breadth. Half the time the slice changes what the rest of the epic should be,
and finding that out on story 1 is far cheaper than on story 6.
Name here which layers the slice must touch.

## Findings
